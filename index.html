        <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
        <hr id="crossline">

        <p>
            I was introduced to Conway's Game of Life sometime last year, 
            and I took a recent interest in it while learning C++. It's 
            based on a cellular automaton structure which, simply put, 
            is a set of cells given some possible states and some set of 
            instructions to follow based on their state.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this idea, Conway's Game of Life is meant to simulate life 
            structures with rules representing underpopulation and overpopulation. In
            a grid of cells, each cell's state is dependent on the cell's "neighbors," 
            which are the eight cells surrounding it. In this model, each cell has two 
            states: alive or dead. Each cell progresses through generations in a certain 
            state depending on its number of living neighbors at a given point, with rules 
            as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="bigtab">
            * Alive with &lt 2 living neighbors -> dead, by underpopulation <br>
            * Alive with > 3 living neighbors -> dead, by overpopulation <br>
            * Alive with 2 or 3 living neighbors -> alive <br>
            * Dead with 3 living neighbors -> alive <br>
            * Otherwise, dead cell stays dead
        </p>
        <p id="cont">
            Conway's cellular automaton is pretty cool in itself, and all trials eventually 
            stabilize into having just a few different periodic structures, such as:

        </div>
        <p id="cont">
            The first shows still structures, like a 2x2 square. The second shows 
            structures which oscillate with period two. The third has period three. 
            And the last is the famous gosper glider gun which produces glider structures 
            that move down and right.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are screenshots/gifs made from my program, which runs in the terminal
            and displays alive and dead cells with text background colors, grey/white meaning
            alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I found most interesting was that, with the random arrangements of live 
            cells that my program would produce, it seemed near impossible to track what
            was really going on until the very end, when these recognizable structures
            would form. And upon research, I couldn't find any mathematical model or algorithm
            that could otherwise predict what would happen to a given grid of cells in Conway's
            Game of Life. Cellular automata are mathematical models on their own, and they're 
            reflective of how computer processing works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the gosper glider gun structure, for instance. It outputs a glider every 
            30 generations, and we can say each traveling glider is analogous to a '1' in 
            binary, and the lack of presence of a glider is a '0'. It's possible to arrange 
            two glider guns perpendicular to each other such that each of their gliders 
            annihilate each other, and that is enough to construct all the logic gates that 
            computers use, 'and,' 'or,' and 'not,' as well as switches. This makes the model 
            Turing complete, meaning these gates can be chained together to mimic any binary 
            operation that computers do. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also interesting to observe the growth patterns with different cell
            instructions, such as when you change the life condition to one neighbor, 
            or you don't allow death for less than two neighbors: <br>
